# FastAPI Q&A Bot

A FastAPI application that allows users to input a paragraph and ask questions based on that paragraph. The bot responds with answers derived from the provided text using pre-defined logic or NLP models.

## Features

- **Input Paragraph**: Provide a block of text for the bot to analyze.
- **Ask Questions**: Ask questions related to the provided paragraph.
- **Get Responses**: Receive answers based on the content of the paragraph.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Run the FastAPI Application**

   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

2. **Open Your Browser**

   - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to interact with the application.
   - Access the interactive API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### API Endpoints

- **POST `/input-paragraph`**:
  - **Description**: Submit a paragraph of text.
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "paragraph": "This is the paragraph where you provide context for the Q&A."
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Paragraph received successfully."
    }
    ```

- **POST `/ask-question`**:
  - **Description**: Ask a question related to the previously submitted paragraph.
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "question": "What is the main topic of the paragraph?"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "answer": "The main topic of the paragraph is ..."
    }
    ```

### Customization

- **Modify Response Logic**: Update the `answer_question` function in `app.py` to change how questions are answered.
- **Add NLP Models**: Integrate NLP models to improve question-answering capabilities.

### Testing
